>**<p align="justify"> Abstract:** *This repository presents the research undertaken in the Vodafone Data Science Challenge (2021). The purpose of the challenge was that of predicting the nature of the Vodafone customers interactions with Tobi Digital Assistant to enhance Vodafone Customer Service. The research was based on a dataset of supervised interactions parameters used to classify customers communications with Tobi. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) along with some inspiration taken from sequence classification models and deep recommender systems, we designed a model to take two inputs, one representing the user history on past interactions and one composed by the sessions events in order to draw conclusions on the nature of the interactions.*

## Introduction 
Many aspects of modern life are reliant on solar energy, from powering our homes and businesses to providing energy for transportation and industry. In this project, we want to accurately predict Solar Irradiance at a specific location starting from meteorological and time factors. A model of the Irradiance can help us better understand and manage this valuable resource, which in turn can lead to more efficient and sustainable energy use. This analysis has a wide range of applications, including improving solar power systems and optimizing solar energy production in different industries. For instance, precise predictions of Solar Irradiance can help solar energy firms in making informed decisions regarding the placement of new solar panels and ways to enhance their efficiency. Furthermore, this examination can also be used to anticipate fluctuations in Solar Irradiance resulting from climate change, which can assist policymakers in developing more effective measures to tackle its impact.
